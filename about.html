    <h1>About Me Page</h1>
    <p> I am currently a first-year student at the University of Rhode Island. My intended major is computer science. I have no previous experience with computer science, so I am excited to learn more about it. I enjoy exercising and hanging out with my family and friends. I hope to learn a lot during my time as a student in CSC 106. <br> This website will show you a little bit more about me on a more personal level. Click away! </p>
