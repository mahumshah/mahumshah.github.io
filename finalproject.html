    <h1>My Final Project: Platformer</h1>
    <p> This webpage will show you the final project that my partner and I have worked on in CSC106. I hope that you can use our work as inspiration and as a learning tool! The program that we have written
    is based on the game of Platformer. In our game, we have the user select which bitmoji they want to use in the game, and then click start. Once the game is started, the user can use the left and right arrows to move 
    left and right, and may also use the up arrow to jump. The goal is to catch all of the letters in a level to spell out a word! If a user falls from the ground, the game will restart. Once level one is completed, a button
    will appear to move onto level 2 of the game, which is a bit more challenging with more obstacles. Once the user spells out the second word successfully, the user has won the game! </p>
