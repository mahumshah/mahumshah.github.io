    <h1>About Me Page</h1>
    <p> I am currently a first-year student at the University of Rhode Island. My intended major is computer science. I have no previous experience with computer science, <br> so I am excited to learn more about it. I enjoy being outside and spending time with my family and friends. I also played lacrosse in high school and really enjoyed it.<br>In my free time, I like to bake. I hope to learn a lot during my time as a student in CSC 106. This website will show you a little bit more about me on a more personal level. Click away! </p>
